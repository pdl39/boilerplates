# ignore all build generated files in the root dist directory except for index.html

# also within dist, include only favicon.ico in dist/assets/favicon/
###
# logic for including a specific file/folder within a subdirectory of an ignored parent directory:
# 1) first un-ignore the subdirectory directly within the ignored parent (e.g. !/dist/assets/)
# 2) then re-ignore everything inside the subdirectory (e.g. /dist/assets/*)
# 3) then re-un-ignore the specific file/folder within the subdirectory (!/dist/assets/favicon/)
# repeat this process for deeply nested directories. The key is that you can only un-ignore the direct child.
# directly un-ignoring the whole path to the desired file/folder will not work (e.g. !/dist/assets/favicon/# favicon.ico)
